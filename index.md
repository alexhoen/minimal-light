## About Me

I am a ph.d. researcher in the [IOL]([https://github.com/ZIB-IOL](https://iol.zib.de/)) group at Zuse-Institut Berlin. I am maintainer of the presolving library [PaPILO](https://github.com/scipopt/papilo) and a developer in [SCIP](https://github.com/scipopt/).

## Research Interests

I study mixed integer linear programming, with a special interest in exact solving of mixed-integer programs.
